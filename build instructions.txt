Building the E-Ink Podcast Player from the Command LineThis guide will walk you through compiling and building the Android application without using Android Studio.Step 1: Install PrerequisitesJava Development Kit (JDK): You need a JDK, version 11 or higher. You can download it from Oracle or use an open-source alternative like OpenJDK.Android SDK Command-Line Tools:Go to the Android Studio downloads page and scroll down to "Command line tools only."Download the package for your operating system and unzip it somewhere on your computer (e.g., C:\android-sdk or ~/android-sdk).Step 2: Set Up Environment VariablesYou need to tell your system where to find the JDK and Android SDK.JAVA_HOME: Set this to the path where your JDK is installed.ANDROID_HOME (or ANDROID_SDK_ROOT): Set this to the path where you unzipped the SDK tools.PATH: Add the Android SDK's cmdline-tools/latest/bin, platform-tools, and emulator directories to your system's PATH variable. This allows you to run commands like sdkmanager and adb from any terminal window.Step 3: Download SDK PackagesOpen a terminal or command prompt and use the sdkmanager to download the necessary platform tools, build tools, and an Android platform version.# Accept all licenses first (run this command and type 'y' for all prompts)
sdkmanager --licenses

# Download necessary packages
sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-34" "build-tools;34.0.0"
Step 4: Create the Project Directory StructureCreate a root folder for your project (e.g., EInkPodcast). Inside it, arrange all the files I provided into the following structure. This is critical for the build system to find everything.EInkPodcast/

├── build.gradle
├── gradle/
│   └── wrapper/
│       └── gradle-wrapper.properties
├── gradlew
├── gradlew.bat
└── settings.gradle
Step 5: Get the Gradle Wrapper FilesThe build system uses a script called the Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) to ensure a consistent build environment. The easiest way to get the necessary files (gradlew, gradlew.bat, and gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar) is to copy them from another project.Go to the official Android basic sample repository.Download that project as a ZIP.From the downloaded ZIP, copy the gradlew file, the gradlew.bat file, and the entire gradle/ directory into the root of your EInkPodcast project folder.Replace the gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties file you just copied with the one I provided above to ensure you're using the correct Gradle version.Step 6: Build the ApplicationNow you are ready to build the APK.Open your terminal or command prompt.Navigate to the root directory of your project (EInkPodcast/).On Linux/macOS, make the gradlew script executable:chmod +x gradlew
Run the build command:On Linux/macOS: ./gradlew assembleDebugOn Windows: gradlew.bat assembleDebugGradle will download all the dependencies and compile your application. If successful, you will find your unsigned, debuggable APK file in app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk.Step 7: Install on a Device or EmulatorConnect an Android device with USB debugging enabled, or start an emulator.Use the Android Debug Bridge (adb), which is part of the platform-tools you downloaded, to install the APK.From your project's root directory, run:adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
You should now see the "EInkPodcast" app on your device!
